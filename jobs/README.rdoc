== README

The task is to create a job posting board that I can use throughout the job hunt.  I should be able to log in and out, once logged in I should be able to see a list of all the job posting I have created.  When you create a job a title is required, you will also have the option to fill out a job URL, location, any notes I may have, date applied, and the status.

You will be able to create the new job and update and edit it.  I am not giving it an option to destroy because I want to keep a record of it.

Should be able to upload attachments for each job specifically a resume (which will proably be the same for all jobs but whatever, and a cover letter which will change job to job)

you should be able to see all job by status ( ones applied, not applied, rejected etc..) or by location.
